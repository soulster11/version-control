How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Using diff allowed me to quickly find the the specific line of code with the error.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Having access to entire history allows me to roll back to previous versions of an application.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git,
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Pros for Manual Commit
1. Your commit history will be easier to read and understand
2. You will not have commits with incomplete code
3. Commits will be made at logical points in the development

Cons for Manual Commit
1. Not making a commit at logical points
2. Committing to often

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit,
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git allows saving of multiple files because in most applications files are related to each other
and need to reference parts of code in differenct files. CakePHP, HTML and CSS are examples of
programming languages that rely on other files to make the code function as a whole.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Using git log pulles all the committs that were done for the selected application. Using git diff allows me to see the differences between the selected committs.
